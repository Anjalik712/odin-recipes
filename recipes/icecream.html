    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This basic vanilla ice cream recipe has been one of my top dessert recipes ever since it made its debut! In fact, it has been a household favorite dessert among so many of my followers.</p>
    <p>This basic recipe involves zero fancy equipment, a few minutes of prep, and only three ingredients, which you can find at any grocery store and a blender.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>Heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract (or vanilla bean)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the three ingredients (plus a dash of sea salt) to a blender or food processor and blend on a low speed just until the ingredients are combined. Avoid blending the mixture for too long in order to avoid the formation of ice crystals. </li>
        <li>Once you have your ice cream base, you can freeze it immediately in a freezer-safe container. Many people transfer the ice cream base to a loaf pan and cover it with plastic wrap to freeze.</li>
        <li>If you do own an ice cream maker, chill the ice cream mixture in the refrigerator for a couple of hours or until the mixture is completely chilled before pouring it into your ice cream maker.</li>
        <li>Turn your ice cream maker on and allow the ice cream to churn until it reaches a thick, soft serve consistency.</li>
        <li>Once the ice cream has finished churning, you can serve it immediately for soft serve consistency, or transfer it to a freezer-safe container and freeze for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Serve with your favorite toppings like chocolate sauce, fresh blueberries and strawberries, and a sprinkle of chocolate chips.</li>
    </ol>
